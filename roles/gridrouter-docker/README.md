You can override collection browsers `grid_router_browsers` according to your needs.
For example:
```yaml
grid_router_browsers:
    - name: "firefox"
      defaultVersion: "54.0"
      versions:
        - "54.0"
    - name: "chrome"
      defaultVersion: "59.0"
      versions:
        - "59.0"
    - name: "opera"
      defaultVersion: "45.0"
      versions:
        - "45.0"
```

All supported browsers see [here](https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid#ready-to-use-browser-images).

Ggr is [using](http://aerokube.com/ggr/latest/#_creating_users_file) htpasswd files to store authentication data. Passwords are stored in encrypted form.
